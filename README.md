# Coastal Harbor Seal Abundance: Shiny App

This repository stores the code and required data for running the Shiny app that was developed for representing harbor seal abundance estimates visually and interactively. This work was done collaboratively with a UW CICOES intern (Allison James) .

The Data folder contains the data required for running the application.

The LegacyCode folder contains older code that was used to develop an earlier iteration of the application.

The primary code for the Shiny App is **CoastalHarborSealAbundance_ShinyApp.R**. The **CoastalHarborSealAbundance_ShinyApp_4EDMW.R** version was presented at the NOAA Environmental Data Management Workshop in 2022.
